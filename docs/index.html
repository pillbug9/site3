<div class="text-wrapper">I confide to anything
So I have to hide from everything.
Everybody wants a piece of me.
Rinse the origin and cease to be
Sit back and let it happen,
Let us take your time away
I don't understand you.
I don't want your time of day.
If you're gonna walk, might as well walk your way,
Always walk the whole ways,
Forget the punk, I pack the funk.
I'm gonna take a piece of you.
Making money for good health, but first I learn to see myself 
Making money for good health, but first I learn to see myself
You've promised me poems 
You've promised me poems
You've promised me poems
I rue the day that I ever met you, 
And deeply regret you getting close to me.
I cannot wait to deeply neglect you,
Deeply forget you, Jesus believe me,
You promised me poems.
You might have been my reason for livin'
I gave up ungivin', gave up everything.
We were a right pair of believers
A couple of dreamers, so how come
You hate me?
You promised me poems
You promised me poems 
You promised me poems 
You promised me poems
Dreamed of ringing voices,
They contemplated choices.
Taste like a rare kiss,
To heighten my awareness.
With all fairness, greatness, with gratitude.
And simply rhymes with attitude
Now do promotion and TV, and ya still can't see.
